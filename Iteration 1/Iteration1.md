**Step 1: Review Inputs**

 

**Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers**

  The main iteration goal of this section is CRN-1, to create and define the overall system structure. This iteration is driven by general architecture of the system, but all drivers in step 1 are being considered as influence within this iteration as it will create the underlying structure of the system.

**Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine**



**Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers**



**Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocated Responsibilities and Define Interfaces**

**Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions**

Use Case 1: Account System
The next diagram is a sequence diagram shows how the user will access the system based on their role within the system. Once the user launches the browser, they will be prompted for account credentials which they will use to login into the system. The account they logged into will tied to a specific role in the system which will define their permissions and access to the system.

Use Case 4: Record System
The next diagram is a sequence diagram that shows how the user will access system records within the course management. Once the users role is determined from the steps in the previous diagram, the user will be able to request information from the server. The server will respond based on the accounts role and the information they request. The user will only be prompted with available information for their specific role.

**Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration**
