**Step 1: Review Inputs**

 

**Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers**

  The main iteration goal of this section is CRN-1, to create and define the overall system structure. This iteration is driven by general architecture of the system, but all drivers in step 1 are being considered as influence within this iteration as it will create the underlying structure of the system.

**Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine**



**Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers**



**Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocated Responsibilities and Define Interfaces**

**Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions**


**Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration**
