**Step 2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers**

**Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the sytem to refine**

**Step 4: Choose one or more design concept that satisfy the selected drivers**

**Step 5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities, and define interfaces**

**Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions**
