**Step 2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers**

**Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the sytem to refine**

**Step 4: Choose one or more design concept that satisfy the selected drivers**

**Step 5: Instantiate architectural elemtns, allocate responsibilities, and define interfaces**

**Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions**

Use Case 1: Account System
The next diagram is a sequence diagram shows how the user will access the system based on their role within the system. Once the user launches the browser, they will be prompted for account credentials which they will use to login into the system. The account they logged into will tied to a specific role in the system which will define their permissions and access to the system.

Use Case 4: Record System
The next diagram is a sequence diagram that shows how the user will access system records within the course management. Once the users role is determined from the steps in the previous diagram, the user will be able to request information from the server. The server will respond based on the accounts role and the information they request. The user will only be prompted with available information for their specific role.

**Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and achienvement of design purpose**
